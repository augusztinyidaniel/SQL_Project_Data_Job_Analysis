‚ùì Question:
Find the average salary both yearly (salary_year_avg) and hourly (salary_hour_avg) for job postings using the job_postings_fact table that were posted after June 1, 2023. Group the results by job schedule type. Order by the job_schedule_type in ascending order.

Calculate average salaries by using the AVG function on both salary_year_avg and salary_hour_avg.
Filter postings with WHERE for dates after June 1, 2023,
Group the results with job_schedule_type.
Use job_schedule_type for ORDER BY.
