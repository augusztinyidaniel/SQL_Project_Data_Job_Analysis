❓Question:

From the job_postings_fact table, categorize the salaries from job postings that are data analyst jobs and who have a yearly salary information. Put salary into 3 different categories:

If the salary_year_avg is greater than $100,000 then return ‘high salary’.
If the salary_year_avg is between $60,000 and $99,999 return ‘Standard salary’.
If the salary_year_avg is below $60,000 return ‘Low salary’.
Also order from the highest to lowest salaries.

🔎 Hint:

In SELECT retrieve these columns: job_id, job_title, salary_year_avg, and a new column for the salary category.
CASE Statement: use to categorize salary_year_avg into 'High salary', 'Standard salary', or 'Low salary'.
If the salary is over $100,000, it's a High salary.
For salaries between $60,000 and $99,999, assign Standard salary.
Any salary below $60,000 should be marked as Low salary.
