/*
‚ùìQuestion:

Calculate the number of unique skills required by each company. Aim to quantify the unique skills required per company and identify which of these companies offer the highest average salary for positions necessitating at least one skill. For entities without skill-related job postings, list it as a zero skill requirement and a null salary. Use CTEs to separately assess the unique skill count and the maximum average salary offered by these companies.

üîé Hints:

Use two CTEs.
The first should focus on counting the unique skills required by each company.
The second CTE should aim to find the highest average salary offered by these companies.
Ensure the final output includes companies without skill-related job postings. This involves use of LEFT JOINs to maintain companies in the result set even if they don't match criteria in the subsequent CTEs.
After creating the CTEs, the main query joins the company dimension table with the results of both CTEs.
