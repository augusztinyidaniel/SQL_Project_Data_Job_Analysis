/*
‚ùìQuestion:

Identify companies with the most diverse (unique) job titles. Use a CTE to count the number of unique job titles per company, then select companies with the highest diversity in job titles.

üîé Hints:

Use a CTE to count the distinct number of job titles for each company.
After identifying the number of unique job titles per company, join this result with the company_dim table to get the company names.
Order your final results by the number of unique job titles in descending order to highlight the companies with the highest diversity.
Limit your results to the top 10 companies. This limit helps focus on the companies with the most significant diversity in job roles. Think about how SQL determines which companies make it into the top 10 when there are ties in the number of unique job titles.
